abstract = {Imaging and identifying target signatures and biomedical markers in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum is broadly important to medical imaging, military target tracking, remote sensing, and industrial automation. However, current silicon-based imaging sensors are fundamentally limited because of the rapid absorption and attenuation of UV light, hindering their ability to resolve UV spectral signatures. Here, we present a bioinspired imaging sensor capable of wavelength-resolved imaging in the UV range. Inspired by the UV-sensitive visual system of the Papilio xuthus butterfly, the sensor monolithically combines vertically stacked photodiodes and perovskite nanocrystals. This imaging design combines two complementary UV detection mechanisms: The nanocrystal layer converts a portion of UV signals into visible fluorescence, detected by the photodiode array, while the remaining UV light is detected by the top photodiode. Our label-free UV fluorescence imaging data from aromatic amino acids and cancer/normal cells enables real-time differentiation of these biomedical materials with 99\% confidence. Papilio xuthus butterfly–inspired camera with perovskite nanocrystals enables cancer cell identification via UV autofluorescence.}}
