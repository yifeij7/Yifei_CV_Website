abstract: Here, we present a bioinspired imaging sensor capable of wavelength-resolved imaging in the UV range. Inspired by the UV-sensitive visual system of the Papilio xuthus butterfly, the sensor monolithically combines vertically stacked photodiodes and perovskite nanocrystals. This imaging design combines two complementary UV detection mechanisms: The nanocrystal layer converts a portion of UV signals into visible fluorescence, detected by the photodiode array, while the remaining UV light is detected by the top photodiode.
