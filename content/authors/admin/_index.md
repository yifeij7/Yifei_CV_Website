## About Me
Yifei Jin is an ECE Ph.D. candidate advised by Dr.Viktor Gruev at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include the design and development of multispectral imaging systems for image-guided cancer surgeries. Before joining Dr.Gruev's lab, I was a hardware engineer responding to circuit verifications for automatic test equipment at Teradyne in North Reading, Massachusetts. I am proficient with optoelectronic characterization, hardware engineering, computer vision, and machine learning. I am seeking an optical and electrical engineering internship for the Summer of 2025.
