        My research centers on developing bioinspired multispectral imaging systems for cancer diagnostics and surgical guidance. Drawing inspiration from the mantis shrimpâ€™s compound eye, I designed a camera capable of simultaneously capturing ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared bands. This platform enables both labeled and label-free fluorescence imaging, with strong implications for advancing image-guided surgery and intraoperative pathology.
        
        Building on this foundation, I created a lensless UVâ€“Visibleâ€“NIR microscopy system that replaces costly optics with a holographic diffuser. This approach not only reduces hardware complexity but also achieves higher resolution and single-shot three-dimensional imaging.

        To further enhance image reconstruction, I developed a 20-layer residual convolutional neural network tailored for multispectral demosaicing. Compared to conventional methods, this architecture significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, yielding higher-quality images critical for clinical translation.
